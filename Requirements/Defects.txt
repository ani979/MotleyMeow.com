1) When posting an event, the event doesnt come to Home page. It needs to be refreshed.
2) Must not be able to post if no title. ( Validation on title) - DONE
3) Validation added in "Post event from FB " is fine but for the event ID it doesnt get removed even when the user keys in texts
4) BG Image on first page need to be changed - Check with Shaurya on that
5) Header is currently loaded ajax way...any other way to load it.
6) In mobile we must be able to browse events by touch.
7) When images in "Who we are" are clicked... the page loads fresh. It should instead hover.
8) In "Invite your friends" we still have Buzzng Artists and Black Tie etc..
