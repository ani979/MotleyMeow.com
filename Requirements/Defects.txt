1) When posting an event, the event doesnt come to Home page. It needs to be refreshed.
2) Must not be able to post if no title. ( Validation on title) - DONE
3) Validation added in "Post event from FB " is fine but for the event ID it doesnt get removed even when the user keys in texts
4) BG Image on first page need to be changed - Check with Shaurya on that
